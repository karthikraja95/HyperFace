1. The file exp1and5.py has the implementation of experiments 1 and 5 as mentioned in the report.
   To run this code for different experiments, we need to change the model file for loading weights,
   and change which layers to update and by using which loss function which is just changing 4 lines of code.

2.The file exp2(a)_frcnn.py trains the frcnn on Genface as mentioned in the report.

3. exp2(b)_frcnn.py does the training as explained in the report for experiment 2(b)
Note that the above two files only train for the frcnn part of the network and not the whole HyperFace.

4. exp2(a)_and2(b)_hyperface_train.py trains the hyperface network for corresponding experiments.

5. exp3_hyperface_train.py does the training for hyperface as given in experiment 3 in report.

6. exp(4)_train.py performs training corresponding to experiment 4 mentiond in the report.

7. data_creation_images.ipynb and data_creation_videos.ipynb were used to generate dataset in the form of numpy files used in training.
